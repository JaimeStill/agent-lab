I'm ready to begin planning Session 3c: Workflow Execution Engine. See the following documents:
 - PROJECT.md: project roadmap
 - MILESTONE_GUIDE: milestone architecture guide
 - SESSION_SUMMARY: previous session summary

Follow all conventions and instructions in CLAUDE.md. Remember that this is a collaborative project, so do not submit an execution plan until we've aligned on all implementation details. I'm here to provide an feedback, clarification, or answers to questions.
