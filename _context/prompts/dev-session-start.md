I'm ready to begin planning SESSION. Reference documents:
- PROJECT.md: project roadmap
- MILESTONE_GUIDE: milestone architecture guide
- SESSION_SUMMARY: previous session summary

Session workflow and conventions are automatically loaded via .claude/rules/.
This is a collaborative project - align on implementation details before execution.

Follow the Development Session Workflow in /development-methodology
